# Tale of two shocks

## Response of the Finnish economy to the European Union carbon policy shocks between 2005 and 2021

Welcome to the repo of my Master's thesis in economics! In this thesis, I set out to explore the impact of the European carbon policy shocks on the Finnish economy using interday price variation of the European Union emission trading certificate futures markets around regulatory changes in the carbon policy regime.

The results of my empirical analysis reveal a dual effect of the structural shocks emanating from the European Union carbon policy regime on the Finnish economy. While they have a short-term stimulating effect, they also have a long-term slowing effect, which is statistically significant. These findings are interestingly different from those of a European Union-wide study, and the thesis also extends previously identified time series on the regulatory surprises.

I hope that this research sparks your interest and encourages you to delve further into the intersection of economics and energy policy. Thank you for visiting my repository, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.
