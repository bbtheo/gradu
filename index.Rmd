The Finnish government has pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in an ambitious timescale. In the Government Programme, the goal of carbon neutrality is set to be achieved by 2035 [@hallitus2019]. For the goal to be completed, Finland would need to become one of the world's first countries with fossil fuel-free energy production. The energy sector's transition is in full force, as the total greenhouse emissions have decreased by twenty-one per cent from the year 1990 [@statfin2022]. Additionally, for the Finnish government to meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement, it will need drastic and urgent measures. In contrast to the topicality of this subject, there has not been research on the macroeconomic impacts of the Finnish economy from the previous climate actions. $\dots$

The concentration on the EU Emission trading system (EU ETS) is relevant as it has been the one policy tool that has been the most widely used (LÃ„HDE??)

This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the effects of policy shocks produced by updating the framework of the EU ETS on the Finnish economy.$\dots$ 

My thesis can then provide new descriptive information on the response of the Finnish economy, which is fundamental for the economic sciences in the future to offer more ingrained prescriptive policy tools. Additionally, I aim to extend the groundbreaking work of @kaenzig2022. With this dual
