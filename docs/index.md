The energy sector's transition is in full force, as the total greenhouse emissions have decreased by twenty-one per cent from the year 1990 [@statfin2022]. 

Additionally, for the Finnish government to meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement, it will need drastic and urgent measures. In contrast to the topicality of this subject, there has not been research on the macroeconomic impacts to the Finnish economy by the previously implemented EU-wide carbon emission reduction policies.

This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the effects of policy shocks produced by updating the framework of the EU ETS on the Finnish economy.$\dots$

Additionally, I aim to extend the groundbreaking work of @kaenzig2022. With this dual goal in my mind
