# Introduction {#intro}



Finnish government has pledged to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions in an ambitious timescale. In the Government Programme the goal of carbon neutrality is set to be achieved by 2035 [@hallitus2019]. For the goal to be achieved, Finland would need to become one of the first countries that have a fossil fuel free energy production in the world. The transition  of the energy sector is in full force, as the total greenhouse emissions have decreased by twenty-one per cent from the level of the of the year 1990 [@statfin2022]. Additionally for the Finnish government to be able to meet their goals set by the Paris Agreement it is going to need drastic and urgent measures. In contrast to the topicality of this subject there has not been research in the macroeconomic impacts of to the Finnish economy from the previous climate actions. $\dots$

Research done by \citeauthor{kaenzig2022} is a $\dots$

The concentration to the EU Emission trading system (EU ETS) is relevant as it has been the one policy tool that has been the most widely used (LÃ„HDE??)

This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the effects of policy shocks produced by the updating of the framework of the EU ETS to the Finnish economy.$\dots$ My thesis is then able to provide new descriptive information of the response of the Finnish economy which is fundamental for the economic sciences in future to be able to provide more ingrained prescriptive policy tools.
